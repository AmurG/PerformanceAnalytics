# Modified PerformanceAnalytics

Contains two extra functions, SharpeError and AdjustedSharpeError, which calculate the error in the Sharpe and Adjusted Sharpe. All documentation done via roxygen2.

Also contains generic but slow wrapper xtsboot that bootstraps error functions for various metrics in PerfA using sample.
